# ObserPy
## ObservaPy is an astronomical obbservation planning program that developed with Python

### Selecting a specific system for the observations of extrema in the light curves of variable stars poses a significant challenge, particularly in cases where observers are confronted with a multitude of systems but face time constraints. Inresponse to this issue, we developed an application with Python to help the observer to determine the most viable system to be observed at any given time. This application also provides information on optimal dates for observing a particularsystem at a specified time interval. Additionally, the application enables users to create detailed logs documenting any observation of a particular target.This is a free, open source program.
